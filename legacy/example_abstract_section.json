While most patients with major burn injuries are cared for at American Burn Association -verified burn centers, many of them present to nonburn centers initially or present with combined burns and other injuries. Despite this, burn surgery is no longer mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for general surgery residency and is rarely a meaningful component of surgical critical care fellowships. However, general surgeons are called to participate in and, occasionally, lead the care of adults and children with burn injuries when burn expertise is not available, for patients with combined burns and other injuries, when procedures are required, in intensive care units, and/or during multiple casualty incidents and disasters. Fundamental burn care knowledge and skills deployed during these moments can radically impact patients' chances of survival and future quality of life. This clinical review covers burn-specific aspects of the primary survey and follows the ABCDE approach. Additional details about core burn care principles (e.g., inhalation injury, resuscitation, wound care) and special considerations in combined burns and other injuries are also presented (e.g., burns with concomitant abdominal, thoracic, skeletal, and/or intracranial injury(ies)).

The remainder, around 10,000 patients each year, have more extensive injuries requiring emergency procedures, critical care, and/or surgery, and 80% of those are cared for at American Burn Association -verified burn centers by well-orchestrated multidisciplinary teams organized to provide high-quality care across the injury continuum. 3 -5 Thus, thousands of burninjured patients are cared for outside of burn centers or present to nonburn centers for stabilization and may require care by general surgeons. Importantly, general surgeons are keystones of care for patients with multidimensional trauma, who represent between 0.5% and 1.2% of injured patients at trauma centers nationally. 6,7",
