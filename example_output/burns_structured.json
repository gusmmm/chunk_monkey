While most patients with major burn injuries are cared for at American Burn Association -verified burn centers, many of them present to nonburn centers initially or present with combined burns and other injuries. Despite this, burn surgery is no longer mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for general surgery residency and is rarely a meaningful component of surgical critical care fellowships. However, general surgeons are called to participate in and, occasionally, lead the care of adults and children with burn injuries when burn expertise is not available, for patients with combined burns and other injuries, when procedures are required, in intensive care units, and/or during multiple casualty incidents and disasters. Fundamental burn care knowledge and skills deployed during these moments can radically impact patients' chances of survival and future quality of life. This clinical review covers burn-specific aspects of the primary survey and follows the ABCDE approach. Additional details about core burn care principles (e.g., inhalation injury, resuscitation, wound care) and special considerations in combined burns and other injuries are also presented (e.g., burns with concomitant abdominal, thoracic, skeletal, and/or intracranial injury(ies)).

The remainder, around 10,000 patients each year, have more extensive injuries requiring emergency procedures, critical care, and/or surgery, and 80% of those are cared for at American Burn Association -verified burn centers by well-orchestrated multidisciplinary teams organized to provide high-quality care across the injury continuum. 3 -5 Thus, thousands of burninjured patients are cared for outside of burn centers or present to nonburn centers for stabilization and may require care by general surgeons. Importantly, general surgeons are keystones of care for patients with multidimensional trauma, who represent between 0.5% and 1.2% of injured patients at trauma centers nationally. 6,7",

Abronchoalveolar lavage sample is sent for gram stain and culture.

Heparin-albuterolmucolytic therapy significantly reduces ventilator days. 20 Multiple mechanical ventilation strategies for severe inhalation injury have been described (e.g., airway pressure release ventilation, high-frequency percussive ventilation).

Carbon monoxide has an affinity for hemoglobin more than 200 /C2 that of oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to hemoglobin creates COHb, which shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left by impairing the release of oxygen in tissues. The result is cellular anoxia.

Acceptable strategies include use of colloid as 1:2 to 1:3 of the total resuscitation rate (e.g., colloid 200 mL/h + LR 400 mL/h = total rate 600 mL/h) or a set rate of colloid (e.g., colloid rate equal to maintenance fluid rate + LR goal-directed resuscitation rate). 40 As with trauma generally, there is evidence that plasma may mitigate endotheliopathy, serve as a particularly effective buffer, and reduce overall resuscitation requirements. 41 Interventional trials of albumin and plasma during burn resuscitation are underway.",

Patients at risk of runaway resuscitations are those with very deep and large burn injuries (e.g., ≥ 60%TBSA), severe inhalation injury, delayed resuscitation, and major medical comorbidities (e.g., cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension). Modifiable risks for runaway resuscitation include prehospital and admission hypothermia, multiple fluid boluses, too high of an initial LR rate, too high of a mean arterial pressure or UOP goal, inappropriate or lack of hourly fluid titrations, and vascular access complications. The strategy for managing runaway resuscitations includes colloid rescue (although typically insufficient alone), abandonment of UOP as a resuscitation endpoint and initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy, high-dose vitamin C, plasma exchange for large but very shallow burns, and ultra-early excision of full-thickness burns (i.e., within the first 24 hours of injury). Note that ultra-early excision requires significant coordination; comanagement of anesthesia, burn shock, and hemorrhage; prevention of acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy; and impeccable multidisciplinary care to perform successfully. However, excision of 50% or more of the total injury and the resultant reduction of the inflammatory load can dramatically change the course of resuscitation for the better. In some cases, comfort-focused measures are appropriate if the injury is thought to be unsurvivable, not aligned with patient's goals of care, or if they are not able to be resuscitated.

            "text": "Full-thickness burns that are circumferential or near circumferential can have a tourniquet effect and prevent softtissue expansion with progressive edema during resuscitation. The result is increased compartment pressures and compartment syndromes. Partial thickness injuries rarely cause compartment syndromes and should not be incised unless there are signs and symptoms of elevated compartment pressures; extremities with partial thickness injury can be elevated to reduce swelling. The extremities are most often affected, but compartment syndromes of the chest, abdomen, neck/head, and eyes have all been described. Escharotomies are required to relieve pressure for all but the eyes where lateral canthotomies can be performed by an experienced provider. Escharotomy is rarely required within the first 2 to 4 hours of injury and thus can be deferred until appropriate resources can be coordinated. The goal of escharotomy is to relieve the pressure by incising only the eschar, which is achieved by incision through the dermis and subdermal bands and does not require incision into the subcutaneous fat, fascia, or muscle (Fig. 2). In cases where the burn injury extends into the muscle or there is more than 4 hours of muscle ischemia from elevated compartment pressures, fasciotomies may also be required. Escharotomy is challenging without sedation, which can be unsafe during a major burn resuscitation. In such cases, controlled endotracheal intubation is preferred. Escharotomies are done under clean conditions. Electrocautery is the preferred tool for the incisions. Extensile incisions are made through the eschar with care to avoid boney prominences. Note that the dermis in partial thickness wounds will bleed -these areas should not be incised. The tense eschar will visually release. Small subdermal bands may prevent full release. These can be palpated and incised. Transverse incisions between the extensile incisions are often required to achieve full release. Bleeding is common and should be systematically controlled to avoid major blood loss. Note that burn-injured patients during resuscitation generally experience both dilutional and consumptive coagulopathy. Use of electrocautery and sutures to control bleeding is typically required. Low-fidelity escharotomy models can be made to simulate this somewhat rare procedure and improve fidelity to recommended best practices. 47",

The skin's strength and functional layer is the dermis, which anchors skin to the tissues beneath and harbors sweat and oil glands, hair follicles, nerve endings, and rich capillary plexuses for thermoregulation. It is the degree of injury within the dermis that determines the burn's ability to heal in a timely manner and with limited morbidity. Superficial burns involve only the epidermis and are dry and erythematous. These injuries, like sun burns, may be painful and cause mild systemic inflammation but are not characterized by loss of skin functions. Partial thickness injuries are those that affect the dermis but no deeper. Some skin appendages remain and can recreate the epidermis with adequate resuscitation, nutrition, wound care, and time. The more dermis that is viable, the more skin appendages remain and the better the healing potential of the wound and lower the risk of hypertrophic scar. Full-thickness injuries destroy the entire dermis and can injure deeper tissues (e.g., subcutaneous fat, fascia, muscle/tendons, bone). Although burn depth is a key factor in wound care planning, other factors are important including patient preferences and tolerances, location of injury, degree of contamination, mobility needs, care capacity, and others.",

Enzymatic debridement can serve as a triage tool and adjunct to routine wound assessment for indeterminant partial thickness wounds. 51 The challenge of accurately assessing the potential for wounds to heal within 2 to 3 weeks with sufficiently low risk of hypertrophic scar is related to our inability to determine the amount of viable dermis remaining in the wound. Enzymatic debridement allows nonsurgical removal of denatured proteins in nonviable dermis and reveals remaining healthy tissue. Reassessment of the wound after enzymatic debridement allows for a more accurate estimation of healing potential. However, the appearance of the wound after enzymatic debridement is different than nondebrided burn wounds and requires acquired expertise. 52 Whenusedasan adjunct towound care with serial examination, enzymatic debridement may facilitate earlier diagnosis of wounds that require excision and reconstruction. Although this care paradigm requires significant capacity building and is best suited for those with mixed deep partial and full-thickness wounds, this technique may be particularly useful when patients cannot be transported to a burn center, during a multiple casualty incident without sufficient access to operating theaters, and in conflict and humanitarian contexts.",

A recent analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank by Grigorian et al. 56 included 6,539,211 trauma patients, 152,686 burn patients, and 33,813 combined injury patients. Several findings were important, including the observation that the impact of burn injuries on mortality of patients with minor trauma (i.e., ISS <16) was lower in 2007 to 2015 compared with 1994 to 2002 (odds ratio [OR] of 2.45 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.26 -2.66] compared with OR of 4.04 [95% CI, 4.51 -4.66]). Meanwhile, the impact of burn injuries on mortality among patients with severe trauma increased (OR of 1.37 [95% CI, 1.29 -1.47] compared with OR of 1.26 [95% CI, 1.05 -1.51]). The impact of the severity of trauma on mortality in combined burn-trauma patients with larger burns (i.e., ≥ 20% TBSA) was negligible. Conversely, an increase in burn size was associated with a near linear increase in mortality for combined injury patients. The largest impact was noted in patients with minor trauma (i.e., ISS <16), very severe trauma (i.e., ISS ≥ 26), and smaller burn sizes (i.e., TBSA <20%). However, for patients with large burn injuries (i.e., TBSA ≥ 20%), ISS had only a negligible contribution to mortality among people with combined injuries. These data suggest that there has been little progress with regard to mortality rates of people with combined large burns and trauma regardless of injury severity. The results contrast with literature demonstrating major improvements in survival for patients with increasingly larger burn sizes and more severe injuries. These more contemporary results suggest that even small burn or other injuries result in increased mortality for people with combined injuries without more strategic approaches to care. Whether this is due to synergistic immunoinflammatory insults, additional challenges to already complex care, or both remain unknown. Therefore, engaged general and trauma surgeons versed in burn care are critical to achieving satisfactory outcomes for people with combined burn and other injuries.",

External fixation can be converted to internal fixation when the patient's physiology allows and stable soft tissue closure can be achieved.

The only sizable description of open abdomen management among patients with major burn injuries reported that the fascia was able to be closed in only 55% of patients. 74 Of those who achieved fascia closure, 38% experienced dehiscence or evisceration that required reexploration. Nearly half of all patients were managed with bridging mesh, skin graft, and planned ventral hernia. The goal is to avoid the need for decompressive laparotomy (e.g., use of ultra-early excision, early continuous renal replacement therapy, and deescalation of resuscitation fluid rates).
